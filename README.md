# Analysis_for_Synergy_Data_Augmentation
This repository provides the analysis process for the synergy data augmentation. It produces the figures for the analysis process in the paper.
## Dependencies
1. Pandas 1.1.3
2. Numpy 1.19.2
## Usage
The following steps provide a guide to reproduce the analysis results presented in the paper.
### Generation of Figure 1
1. Run ```python Correlation_drug_pair.py```<br />
This will calculate the Kendall tau correlation coefficients for the drug pairs.
2. Run ```python make_pic50_scatter.py```<br />
This code produces Figure 1 using the file generated by the first step.
